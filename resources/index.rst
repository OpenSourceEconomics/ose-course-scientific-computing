Throughout the course we will make heavy use of `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ and its `SciPy ecosystem <https://www.scipy.org>`_ as well as `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_.  We maintain a curated list of resources for self-study `here <https://opensourceeconomics.github.io/resources>`_.
