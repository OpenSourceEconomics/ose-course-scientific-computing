The sound analysis of computational economic models requires expertise in economics, statistics,
numerical methods, and software engineering. We first provide an overview of basic numerical methods
for optimization, numerical integration, approximation methods, and uncertainty quantification.
We then deepen our understanding of each of these topics in the context of a dynamic model of human
capital accumulation using `respy <https://respy.readthedocs.io>`_. We conclude by showcasing basic
software engineering practices such as the design of a collaborative and reproducible development
workflow, automated testing, and high-performance computing.

Students learn how to use `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ for advanced scientific computing.
They acquire a toolkit of numerical methods frequently needed for the analysis of computational
economic models, obtain an overview of basic software engineering tools such as
`GitHub <https://www.github.com>`_ and `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`_, and are exposed to
high-performance computing using
`multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
and `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io>`_.

We build the course on the `Nuvolos.cloud <https://nuvolos.cloud>`_ as an integrated research and
teaching platform. The platform provides a simple, browser-based environment that allows for
complete control over studentsâ€™ computational environment and simplifies the dissemination of
teaching material. It enables students to seamlessly scale up their course projects from a
prototype to a high-performance computing environment.
