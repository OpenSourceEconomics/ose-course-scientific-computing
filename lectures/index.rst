We provide a set of lectures as `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_.


=======
Tooling
=======

We showcase the basics of Python programming and point students to useful resources to study further. There are numerous excellent introductory lectures on Python programming in economics available online. Among them is `Python programming for economics and finance <https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html>`_ and we will sample some of their material for our lecture.

================
Linear equations
================

We explore different solution algorithms to solve linear equations. We look at direct methods
building on L-U decomposition as well as iterative methods. We study the impact of ill-conditioned
matrices on the performance of algorithms. In the process, we learn some basic ideas behind testing
and benchmarking numerical routines.
