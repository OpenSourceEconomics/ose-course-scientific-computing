Linear equations
================

We explore different solution algorithms to solve linear equations. We look at direct methods building on L-U decomposition as well as iterative methods. We study the impact of ill-conditioned matrices on the performance of algorithms. In the process, we learn some basic ideas behind testing and benchmarking numerical routines.
